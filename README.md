# 2DGameDev
2D Game development project

To run this project you need to download SDL2 and SDL2_Image "development libraries" for Windows:
https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

Hook up the include and bin directories in Visual studio and you're good to go.
BTW use the x86 versions of everything - even though it comes with x64 additionally

## Contents
So far this project has a game loop and skeletal structure for the rest of the game. 
See main.cpp for gameloop mechanics and the handling of input via SDL in sense_player_input() function
